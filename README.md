# StudentSuccessHub
The Student Success Hub was developed to address the growing workload at the Office of Guidance and Counseling, which currently operates with only three staff members.  This web application is strictly for the office; however, it may serve as a guide for those who seek to do the same.

The current PHP version when this program was made: PHP 8.0.30

Requirements to run this web application
📍Xammp
📍MySQL
📍phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
📍phpmailer

Note 
📍The queries used for the database tables are included in this file. If you're trying to run this program, you will need to modify the MySQL credentials.
📍Forgot Password may not also work since we used a personal account for the sender.
📍PHP Composer and Mailer are also included in this file.
